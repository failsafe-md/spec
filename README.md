# FAILSAFE.md

**Safe fallback and recovery protocol for AI agents — revert to last known good state when something goes wrong.**

FAILSAFE.md is a plain-text Markdown file you place in the root of any AI agent project. It defines fallback triggers (unexpected errors, data corruption, memory loss, contradictory instructions), safe state definitions (last clean commit, verified backups, config rollback), automated recovery steps (snapshot, notify, pause, resume), and audit logging — so your agent can recover autonomously from transient failures.

## The AI Agent Safety Stack

FAILSAFE.md is part of a twelve-file open standard for AI agent safety, quality, and accountability:

### Operational Control

### Accountability

| Spec | Purpose | Repo | Site |
|------|---------|------|------|
| FAILURE.md | Failure mode mapping — every error state and response | [failure-md/spec](https://github.com/failure-md/spec) | [failure.md](https://failure.md) |

## Why This Exists

AI agents spend money, send messages, modify files, and call external APIs — often autonomously. Regulations are catching up:

- **EU AI Act** (August 2026) — mandates human oversight and shutdown capabilities
- **Colorado AI Act** (June 2026) — requires impact assessments and transparency
- **US state laws** — California, Texas, Illinois and others have active AI governance requirements

These specifications give you a standardised, auditable record of your agent's safety boundaries.
